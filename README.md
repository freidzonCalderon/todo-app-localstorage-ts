# To-Do Application with Complete CRUD Features and LocalStorage Integration

## [Live Demo Click Here](https://todo-app-crud-ts.netlify.app/).

This is a simple To-Do app where you can manage daily tasks. You can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) your todos using a user-friendly interface built with React JS, Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. With this app, you can easily mark them as completed or pending, edit them as you wish, and delete them when you are done.

The app was built using LocalStorage, which means that if you refresh the page or close the browser, your To-Do list will still be available. This feature allows you to keep track of your tasks without losing them.

### Technologies used: React JS, Typescript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, LocalStorage

To create a new task, click the (+) button and add a 'To-Do' item to your list. If you want to correct or modify a task, use the button with the pencil icon. To delete a task, click the trash button next to it. To mark a task as complete, just check the box next to it.
